    "Managing data in Lists and Dictionaries is for the convenience of passing the data across the internet, to applications, or preparing it to be stored into a database.  It is a great way to exchange data between programs and programmers.  Exchange of data between programs includes the data type the method/function and the format of the data type.  These concepts are key to learning how to write functions, receive, and return data.  This process is often referred to as an <mark>Application Programming Interface (API)</mark>. \n",
    "\n",
    "Next, we will take the stored data and output it within our notebook.  There are multiple steps to this process...\n",
    "- <mark>Preparing a function to format the data</mark>, the print_data() function receives a parameter called \"d_rec\" short for dictionary record.  It then references different keys within [] square brackets.   \n",
    "- <mark>Preparing a function to iterate through the list</mark>, the for_loop() function uses an enhanced for loop that pull record by record out of InfoDb until the list is empty.  Each time through the loop it call print_data(record), which passes the dictionary record to that function.\n",
    "- Finally, you need to <mark>activate your function</mark> with the call to the defined function for_loop().  Functions are defined, not activated until they are called.  By placing for_loop() at the left margin the function is activated."
